Listen, listen
Remember the wane
Of son's Fury and waving grain
We fell and fell
And danced along
To croon a knell
Of rights and wrongs

And
My son, my son
Remember the burn
When leaves with fire and seasons turned
We fell and fell
And sang a song
To weave a Cell
All autumn long

And
Down in the vale
Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swing
The reaper swing
Down in the vale
Hear the reaper sing
A tale of winter long

My girl, my girl
Remember the chill
When rains froze and snows did kill
We fell and fell
And danced along
Through icy hell
To their winter song

My love, my love
Remember the cries
When winter died for spring skies
They roared and roared
But we grabbed our seed
And sowed a song
Against their greed

My son, my son
Remember the chains
When gold ruled with iron reins
We roared and roared
And twisted and screamed
For ours, a vale
Of better dreams

And
Down in the vale
Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swing
The reaper swing
Down in the vale
Hear the reaper sing
A tale of winter done
